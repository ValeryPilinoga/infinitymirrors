## What it does
It creates a mirror with two smaller mirrors inside. User can place it anywhere in the world. He or she can move and scale it according to own preferences.

### Common effect showcase:
1) point your camera at your friend and move the mirror wherever he wants
2) let your friend pretend like he's holding the mirror (you can easily move the mirror in his hands)
3) you can even tap at the object to make inner mirrors rotate
4) take a photo or capture a video!
